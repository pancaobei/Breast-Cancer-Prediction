# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project involves analyzing and predicting breast cancer patient survival using various data visualization and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

We aim to visualize key relationships between patient characteristics and survival outcomes, and build a prediction model to assess whether a patient will survive based on various factors such as age, race, and ES/PR status.

## Features

- Data visualization using **stacked bar charts** and **scatter plots**.
- Logistic regression model to predict **Survived** or **Died** based on patient attributes.
- Use of **R Studio** for data processing, analysis, and model building.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: R
- **Tools**: R Studio
- **Libraries**: ggplot2, dplyr, and caret

## Key Visualizations

- Stacked bar chart displaying survival distribution by tumor stage and age.
- Scatter plot comparing status with age, survival months, tumor stage (T.Stage), lymph node stage (N.Stage), and status.

## Machine Learning Model

- **Logistic Regression**: A classification model built to predict survival based on patient data.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pancaobei/R.git
   ```
2. Open the R project in **R Studio**.
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "caret"))
   ```
4. Run the R scripts to visualize data and train the model.
